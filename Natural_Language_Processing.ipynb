        "To perform the analysis, the opinions were categorized into positive which means that the users were satisfied with the qualtiy of the service, negative meaning that the users were not happy with the quality of the servie and neutral meaning that the users were neither very happy nor disappointed by the airline services. This helps in breaking the task to a classification problem which falls under the category of supervised machine learning. Thus, out of the **'lexicon or the rule based'** approach and the **'Automatic ML based'** approach we will explore the automated appraches of understanding the sentiment of the author and then predicting it as well."

We can form a feature out of number of sentences in the tweet or number of punctuations in the tweet. However, tweets are not written like normal script and could also contain smileys and excessive use of special characters. Essentially number of sentences and punctuation marks also work like the length of the tweet so we can ignore these features and include just the length of tweet as a feature.  \n",

[mention] you make it hard to fly with you. delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around & heading back to the gate. [hashtag]? [mention]  serious firing needs to happen at hnl. they broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine!

[mention] just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available [mention] [mention] so why did you cancelled flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn\\'t like the exchange rate? [hashtag] [mention] do you have an e-mail address i can write my account to? might be less likely to disappear [mention] so i wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn\\'t receive, how do i know this won\\'t happen this time? [mention] 877 from amsterdam to ewr, 02.27.2015, 737-300. [mention] stuck here in iah waiting on flight 253 to honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. could we have gotten a new plane!?!? fail [mention] [mention] [mention] what kind of hypocrisy is that? only cancelled flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage [hashtag] [mention] no. the entire problem here is that i was never sent anything via email and only given a flight booking problems number over the phone. [mention] calling that number was useless. heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke. [mention] they couldn\\'t get me first class on any of their flights so i just rebooked myself. [mention] but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...[hashtag] [mention] i\\'ll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  united airlines should be ashamed.

[mention] [mention] i\\'ll be checking often. most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed.

[mention] oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  flight 1137 has been awful [mention] that\\'s the 1st sorry i received from your company. the least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.

[mention] you gladly take the loyal customer\\'s money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.

[mention] 1st a late flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. you call this customer service?? [mention] due to your expensive change fees either. out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. stranded!! no help! [mention] we can\\'t afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can\\'t afford to go home. [mention] but it\\'s not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. really?

[hashtag] [mention] had 2 cancelled flight my trip to la bc weather [mention] was easy but us air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. never again [mention] what\\'s the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don\\'t scan it  for tracking? [mention] no access to dividend miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back late flightr. [hashtag] [hashtag] [mention] you can\\'t even track my bag to see where it is. it\\'s like it\\'s disappeared. [mention] can\\'t get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. it\\'s been over a month since travel & i\\'ve submitted twice online [mention] i been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. this sucks !! [mention] is there gonna be a better day to call? i\\'ve called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person. [mention] i spent more on the room & transportation then i did the whole flight [mention] i ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that i had to spend [mention] i asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service [mention] only to come home a day late flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage [mention] doubt it. gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter i saw (including one with me) was outright rude. just very put off. [mention] i have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport [mention] the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do? [mention] so mad i can\\'t even believe  you guys cancelled flight my connecting flight after i leave the first stop, & give me a useless hotel voucher [mention] priorities should have been made. considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour & a half? i\\'d like an answer. [mention]: i experienced what defines customer service on [hashtag]. a flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges [mention] i\\'ve done everything. still no luck in finding my bag. i don\\'t understand how my bag could have been misplaced. very upsetting. [mention] that wasn\\'t my q but thanks. wondering why you\\'re the only ones. i disguised yours to not call you out.

[hashtag] [mention] thanks!  can you help remind the agents it\\'s ok?  ps. heard rumors of a streaming wifi tv/movie service you might be installing [mention] nope, done. was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn\\'t get home until midnight. [hashtag] [mention] the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone. [mention] would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold? [mention] would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation? [mention] would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire [mention] would it kill you to let me know how many minutes i might be on hold? [mention] a $100 [mention] - totaled. not happy. not at all. [mention] i have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply\\'s [hashtag] [mention] the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is \"i don\\'t really know what happened\" .[mention] thanks!
